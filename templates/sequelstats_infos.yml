         **ZR:** ZMW read


         **PR:** Polymerase read


         **SR/LSR:** "Subread"/"Longest subread"


         **ZOR:** ZMW occupancy ratio (i.e. how many of the ZMWs in the SMRTcell contained at least one DNA fragment for
         sequencing. Values >0.5 usually indicate overloading)


         **PSR:** Polymerase read to Subread ratio (for assebmly a PSR=1 would be ideal as in that case the fragment would
         have been read only once without reaching the end)


         **Hn** ("High quality region: negative"): Basecaller couldn't find a region in the ZMW read it would consider
         "proper" sequence. This data is stored in "scraps"


         **HpSn** ("High quality region: positive; Subread: negative"):  A good ZMW read interval was found but for some
         reason the sequence is considered 'bad'. This data is stored in "scraps"


         **HpSp** ("High quality region: positive; Subread: positive"): Fully useful data. This data is stored in subreads file.
