## SMRTino

Automatic processing and reporting for PacBio SMRT Cell data.

This is indended to complement the reports in SMRTLink. In particular there is a BLAST-based
contamination check and also some summary metrics, and notification of progress to RT.

Ideally I'd like to integrate this more closely with the SMRTLink reports, or at least find
a way to hot-link from one to the other. It's a little tricky.
