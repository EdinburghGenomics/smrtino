We have these pseudo-runs that the instrument generates, and we need to have
them dealt with so we don't need to manually close all the tickets.

eg. /lustre-gseg/smrtlink/sequel_seqdata/r64175e_20230220_093234

Questions:

1) How do we detect such runs, and can they be detected when the pipeline first sees the run or
do we have to wait for the metadata to land?

2) Do we want to avoid making a ticket entirely, or do we just want to close the ticket using
an adaptation of the existing aborted cells mechanism?

3) Should we even have an output directory? I think we do need one because I don't want to have
to parse the XML for every old pseudo-run every time to see that it is a pseudo-run.

Ways to do this:

I could try to be clever and say that pseudo-runs process quickly (within 10 minutes) so if I see
a really new run I could wait a little while to see if it reveals itself as a pseudo-run and if
so avoid making a ticket. But adding timing considerations to the pipeline is meh.

Or I could just hold off making a ticket at all until the info for the first cell comes in, but
then people expect to see a ticket as soon as the run starts so I don't think that's very good.

So I guess that gives me:

* Add a new status "testrun" which basically works the same as "aborted"
 * Modify pb_run_status.py and add a test - DONE

* Continue to process new runs as before (there's no 0-cell report now since we're doing per-cell reports)

* When the cell completes, detect if it's a test cell and if so:
 * Close the ticket
 * Touch pbpipeline/testrun to make the run done with

I need a test run detector. I guess I'll make it a smal Python script: is_testrun.py

Script should return 0 only if it is sure the CWD contains a test run. If not, it returns 1.
If it can't tell, it returns 2. Within driver.sh I can then just say "if is_testrun.py ; then ..."
I think this will want to be a Python script so it can parse XML, but I'm not sure. Maybe
we can just grep? Yeah, actually:

$ grep -F 'InstrumentId="Inst1234"' /lustre-gseg/smrtlink/sequel_seqdata/*/1_A01/.*.run.metadata.xml

Seems as good an option as any.
