In SMRTLink v11, we have the option to do on-instrument 5mC calls with primrose.

But this discards the kinetics data, so we don't.

But then this step has to be done by manually starting a "5mC CpG Detection" job
in SMRTLink for each flowcell. Boo.

So let's adapt the existing hifi_bam job to call Primrose instead of just the dataset filter.
The FASTQ and FASTA outputs can stay as they were. We can decide if we care about these or not.

So the Primrose command line is, according to
/lustre-gseg/smrtlink/data/cromwell-executions/pb_detect_methyl/fd887dad-6057-44ec-ad10-823d0522595c/call-pbprimrose/execution/script

primrose \
  --log-level DEBUG \
  --log-file primrose.log \
  --alarms alarms.json \
  --num-threads 9 \
  --append-dataset-name " (5mC)" \
  --qv-histogram-report primrose.report.json \
  filtered.consensusreadset.xml \
  with_5mC.consensusreadset.xml

I need to find out what --alarms is about. Other than that, it seems to be pretty much a drop-in replacement for the existing
BAM creation. No splitting of chunks or anything like that, which is good.

The above command will (I believe) yield a file named "with_5mC.bam" as well as a .pbi file for the same. We'll need to rename this.

Not quite, but I got it done. The output looks great. And the Q>20 filtering just seems to work. Nice.
