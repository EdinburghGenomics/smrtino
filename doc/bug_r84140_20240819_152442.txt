On this run, one of the cells failed to produce a report with this error:

Processing done. Now for Snakefile.report
/home/edg01/edg01/pipeline/smrtino/current/driver.sh: line 155: pbpipeline/report.started: cannot overwrite existing file
Attempting to notify error to RT

Looks like a race condition. My first thought is that the pipeline was processing two cells in
parallel and it tried to create "pbpipeline/report.started" when this was already there.
Does that look possible?

Yes, very possible. Clearly this does not happen much as report generation is quick, but I do
need to resolve the bug. How?

1) Lock the reports per cell, rather than with a global lockfile pbpipeline/report.started.
That seems fine for Snakefile.report but the rsync upload needs to
be guarded. But if I'm doing it that way, why not just use the lock pbpipeline/${cell}.started,
rather than holding a separate report lock?

2) Find a way to wait on the lock. Actually this is pretty easy, if I don't mind polling (which
I don't) so maybe I should just do that. Yeah. But for now I can just re-run the report to get
the thing sorted.

Done. I now wait up to five minutes for the lock to clear. If it takes any longer it's reasonable to
assume that something did jam up, and failure is appropriate.
