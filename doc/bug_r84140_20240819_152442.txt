On this run, one of the cells failed to produce a report with this error:

Processing done. Now for Snakefile.report
/home/edg01/edg01/pipeline/smrtino/current/driver.sh: line 155: pbpipeline/report.started: cannot overwrite existing file
Attempting to notify error to RT

Looks like a race condition. My first thought is that the pipeline was processing two cells in
parallel and it tried to create "pbpipeline/report.started" when this was already there.
Does that look possible?

Yes, very possible. Clearly this does not happen much as report generation is quick, but I do
need to resolve the bug. How?

1) Lock the reports per cell. That seems fine for Snakefile.report but the rsync upload should
be guarded. But if I'm doing it that way, why not just use the lock pbpipeline/${cell}.started?

2) Find a way to wait on the lock. Actually this is pretty easy, if I don't mind polling (which
I don't) so maybe I should just do that. Yeah. But for now I can just re-run the report to get
the thing sorted.
