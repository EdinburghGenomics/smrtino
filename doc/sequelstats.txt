As a second version we can add sequelstats (https://github.com/VertebrateResequencing/SEQUELstats)
to the above formed webpage.  This will allow generation of some pretty plots and more information
regarding the quality of the run.

I've not looked at this. When I do, notes will go here.

It looks a bit crufty, but given what it does this shouldn't be a problem. Let's check it out and
give it a go.

Awww - isn't it cute when biologists try to write code. Most of the shell scripts are just tail-chasing
and repeating things already done. So it looks like we can skip SEQUELstats entirely as that is trying
to drive pbrun.

Possibly it makes some directories we need but it looks like SEQUEL_pipe makes these anyway. OK, so
then it runs a loop of:

for each line in the input
  for each of the internal steps
    run the step

And I can safely run all the lines in parallel (but the steps need to run in series). So it looks
like I'm best to just supply a one-line file each time?! We'll see.

Directory structure pre-made:

$ tree stats_726/
stats_726/
├── err
├── out
└── stats
    ├── Hn
    ├── HpSn
    └── HpSp

The SEQUEL_pipe doesn't make the stats subdirs but that's really no problem if I have to add a line.

After the loop of steps it moves some files around and then it runs SEQUEL_plot.R on all the results.
This is the only point where it actually uses the sample name parameter.

So, to snake-make-ify I'll have one rule that runs all the steps and moves the files at the end.
    This will run on a single BAM pair and I'll just feed singleton lines to it, like:

    for step in 01 02 03 04 ; do
        SEQUEL_pipe.sh <(echo foo.subreads.bam) <(echo foo.scraps.bam) ./sequel_pipe 1 STEP_$step
    done

    I don't want to try deconstructing SEQUEL_pipe.sh to run the steps directly, since there is a bunch
    of environmental set-up as well as making the directories.

    Actually the pipe trick doesn't work as the script reads the files repeatedly (of course!) and also
    inspects them to ensure they are regular files (why not!).

Then I'll have a second rule that runs once per run and does all the plots.

So I tested it and I get the error:

"./stats_726_2/m54041_180323_022007/processed/PRO.m54041_180323_022007.txt.HpSp.aCnt" is empty, check input file!

Well the directory HpSp got created, but there's nothing in it. Are there any logs? No - they seem to have gone for
the diaper pattern of hiding all the errors until it's too late.

Ah. Hang on. I put the files in the wrong way around. Maybe try again...
