Here are my thoughts on extracting all of this:

Sign off Date - Checker needs to fill this in. Should also have sign-off user.

RUN
Movie Time (hours) - AutomationParameter Name="MovieLength" in cell.metadata.xml
Divide by 60 to get hours

Library type - We have WellSample/Application but this just says "other"
Probably still needs manual input?
Well, we have "Other WGS" in the Sample Setup.

Adaptive loading -  AutomationParameter Name="DynamicLoadingCognate" in cell.metadata.xml
SMRT Cell Lot Number - CellPac in cell.metadata.xml
Well Sample Name - got it
Well name - got it
Run started - got it. Convert to date

SAMPLE LOADED
Insert size - WellSample / InsertSize in cell.metadata.xml
Sample Concentration (ng/ul) - Get from Sample Setup in SMRTLink
Sample Concentration (nM) - Get from Sample Setup in SMRTLink
Sample Volume to Use - Get from Sample Setup in SMRTLink
Concentration after clean-up (ng/ul) - Get from Sample Setup in SMRTLink
% of  recovery (anticipated) - Get from Sample Setup in SMRTLink
% of  recovery (real) - calculated

I'll almost certainly need an API query to get this info, but that
should be do-able.

RAW DATA
Polymerase Read Bases (Gb) - in raw_data.report.json within the .reports.zip
Polymerase Reads (M) - ditto
Polymerase Read N50 - ditto
Longest Subread N50 - ditto
Unique Molecular Yield (Gb) - ditto
LOADING
P0 % - in loading.report.json within the .reports.zip
P1 % - ditto, but note the comment about this being recalculated
P2 % - ditto
OPLC (pM), On-Plate Loading Conc. - WellSample / OnPlateLoadingConcentration in cell.metadata.yaml
Real OPLC (pM), after clean-up - calculated off "% of  recovery" above

HiFi DATA
HiFi Reads (M) - we break this down by barcode but we want the metrics for the whole cell
                get from ccs.report.json
HiFi Yield (Gb) - ditto
HiFi Read Length (mean, bp) - ditto
HiFi Read Length (median, bp) - ditto
HiFi Read Quality (median) - ditto
HiFi Bases Quality ≥Q30 (%) - ditto
HiFi Number of Passes (mean) - ditto
HiFi LENGTH % - ditto, but we need to shred the table a bit more
 ≥ 5,000 bp
≥ 10,000 bp
≥ 15,000 bp
≥ 20,000 bp
HiFi QUALITY % - ditto
≥ Q30
≥ Q40
BARCODES
Number of samples - easy.
CV - also easy, but I need to check a barcoded run. Do we calculate this or just report it?
CONTROL
Number of Control Reads - in control.report.json
Control Read Length Mean - ditto
Control Read Concordance Mean - ditto
Control Read Concordance Mode - ditto

ADAPTER - yep, we have adapter.report.json
Adapter Dimers (0-10bp) %
Short Inserts (11-100bp) %
Local Base Rate

INSTRUMENT - we have this stuff
Run ID
Instrument SN
Instrument Control SW Version
Instrument Chemistry Bundle Version
Primary SW Version

DATASET
Movie ID
Biological Sample Name
Cell ID
Data created
LINKS
SMRT link report link
SMRTINO report link

FILE NAME - generate dbased on date, ws_name, well, cellid. Easy.

Raw Data Report. This isn't in the XML. But can I get the info shown at:
https://edgen-smrtlink.epcc.ed.ac.uk:8243/sl/data-management/dataset-detail/aef65a28-e77b-4d73-bedf-6512594eed84?type=ccsreads&show=summary-0d4286d2-b27d-441d-8843-bb653cebf341
From the file:
/mnt/lustre/gseg/smrtlink/sequel_seqdata/r84140_20241008_153609/1_A01/statistics/m84140_241008_153920_s4.zmw_metrics.csv.gz

Well, if I add up all the read lengths I get: 191,926,381,621 which is an order of magnitude lower than the 1.034 TB in the report.
It's in the region of the "Unique Molecular Yield" but not the same. Hmmm.

Oh, hang on. All the goodies are within m84140_241008_153920_s4.reports.zip. Right, we can unpack these.

So, we can attack this in stages:

1) Add a rule that unpacks the reports from the zip. Maybe into reports_zip to make it obvious.

DONE

2) Add to compile_cell_info.py, which will actually extract the numbers into the YAML, with
reformatting or recalculation as necessary

3) Then I'll have to surface all this onto the main report, so I'll have to work out how to format
it all as a datatable. Or Javier wants me to generate the existing spreadsheet but I don't like
that idea. The master table looks like something that should go onto Ragic. Maybe the pipeline can push
the record, and then there will just be a signoff button? Hmmm.

This is going to be redundant if they still use the old spreadsheet, but I may as well do it anyway.
