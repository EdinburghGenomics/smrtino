What do we know about the Revio?

It still uses SMRTLink (12+) and SMRT cells.

It can run cells in parallel (but SMRTino should be able to cope with that!)

It has a ?new? optimised file format. But I'm not sure about this. The public
datasets at https://www.pacb.com/connect/datasets/ look to be just HiFi BAM.

So I think we'll just assume that the Revio will be a big deal and benefit from
these SMRTino enhancements and I should push on with the plan accordingly.

But as we discover more, add notes here:
