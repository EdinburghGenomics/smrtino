In SMRTino 1.1.7, the ststus on all the final reports was "reporting".

I thought I'd be clever and force it to be "complete".

But now intermediate reports are showing as complete. Grrr.

The report is generated by the make_report rule in Snakefile.report.

This runs make_report.py and sets "--fudge complete". But this is clearly wrong.

Going backwards, this rule is triggered by run_report() in driver.sh requesting
report_main which requests run_report.{cc}cells.pan.

Within run_report.sh there is a $_pstatus and an $_rt_run_status

$_pstatus is a textual description and is passed to the Snakefile as a config item (pstatus).

But then Snakefile.report ignores it.

Clearly, something is wrong. Oh.

So, I think $_pstatus should be set to the same as $_rt_run_status which may be:

new
awaiting_cells
[nothing]

If set, it gets picked up by send_summary_to_rt() and changes the ticket status.
So we don't want to touch this.

So what do we want?? When run_report is called from action_processed it should set pstatus
and then the Snakefile should pay attention to it.

OK, I've made the three status parts both mandatory and explicit, and cleaned the code a
bit, and set the --fudge properly in the Snakefile. So that should be sorted.
