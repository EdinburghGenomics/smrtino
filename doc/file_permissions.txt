On trying to run SMRTino for the first time on live data I hit a problem. The pipeline user cannot
write to any of the run directories in /ifs/sequel and therefore cannot create a pbpipeline directory.

Hmmm. I could just write the directory one level up, but I don't want to do this. It makes sense (to me)
that the processing status is stored in with the run.

So - can I do something with sudo?

Nope. The entire file system is mounted read-only.  So, I guess unless we want to change that I need a
re-think about where the pipeline directory goes. Just shift it to the output dir, I guess.
And replace the output symlink with an input symlink and remove pbpipe_from entirely.
And we need a way to check that the output directory is really available, so let's have a file called
.smrtino that sits in the output directory and must be present, as a sanity check. If the driver can't
see the file it will refuse to run.

Ick. It does mean a fairly arbitrary difference compared to Illuminatus, and a fair amount of re-coding
the tests, but I do think it is the best way to go. So I have done this - SMRTino now has no call to write
anything to the source file system.

(This would never quite work for Illuminatus as it does have to manipulate sample sheets plus bcl2fastq expects to
be able to write back.)
