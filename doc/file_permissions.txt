On trying to run SMRTino for the first time on live data I hit a problem. The pipeline user cannot
write to any of the run directories in /ifs/sequel and therefore cannot create a pbpipeline directory.

Hmmm. I could just write the directory one level up, but I don't want to do this. It makes sense (to me)
that the processing status is stored in with the run.

So - can I do something with sudo?

Nope. The entire file system is mounted read-only.  So, I guess unless we want to change that I need a
re-think about where the pipeline directory goes. Just shift it to the output dir, I guess.
And replace the output symlink with an input symlink and remove pbpipe_from entirely.
And we need a way to check that the output directory is really available, so let's have a file called
.smrtino that sits in the output directory and must be non-empty.

Ick.
