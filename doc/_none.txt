In SMRTino v3.2.0, when I run the final report (line 320 of driver.sh) I was running it with
--config cells="_None". I clearly gave this some thought, but I have no idea why I did it.
It bypasses all actual report making, and just triggers the list_projects rule.

Why didn't I just run the list_projects rule? Why can't I make the reports, if they happen
to be missing?

So I've put the code back to what looks more sensible, but surely I had a reason for doing it
this silly way in the first place? Maybe when it fails I'll remember, and then I'll put the
explanation here.

For now, I've simplified it. Let's see what breaks.

Several runs later - Apparently nothing. OK.
