Runs from now on are going to be given K123 numbers which tie in to the Access database
and will be entered into the "ExperimentId" field. This has some consequences for SMRTino:

1) The run as saved in /lustre-gseg/smrtlink/sequel_seqdata/ will be in a subdirectory,
so at present SMRTino can't find it unless we make a symlink manually.

2) The K number wants to appear in the report. It gets saved explicitly to
.m64175e_221012_112607.run.metadata.xml (note: it's a hidden file) but we don't currently
read this (I think?) so we need to either read it or else get the K number implictly
from the consensusreadset.xml.

First question, does the syntax:

X="${X:-y}"

work if the original X is a list? Yes it does. Cool. With or without the "". We can
use this for $RUN_NAME_REGEX. The idea is that we'll allow RUN_NAME_REGEX to be a list,
and allow any match. We'll also allow it to have / chars to trigger drilling into subdirs.

But how? I could glob for * and */* but this gets inefficient and only supports 1 level down.
How about a recursive strategy? If the directory matches a regex, then process that directory.
Else if it matches a partial regex, list the subdirs and push them on the stack, then
proceed. Let's make a test script.
