I added support for barcodes to Hesiod. I'm pretty happy with how it
has come out and I think I did things right for that system. However:

- It took a lot of work, spanning Hesiod itself, the np_utils, and
  the delivery script.
- There is no good way to input the sample manifest data (it should
  go into some sort of LIMS!)

For SMRTino, barcodeing is more complex beacause we have different
barcode schemes that act in different ways, and also we have SMRTLink
which is kind of a LIMS (or at least provides a database of sample names
and an interface to enter them).

So, I think for this pipeline we keep SMRTino as it is, and we look
at having a facility to query demultiplexing info from SMRTLink in the
pb_utils scripts, and then look to use this for delivery. Yeah.

OK, more notes here as I investigate further:
