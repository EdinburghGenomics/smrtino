In July/August 2023, I'm calling this SMRTino 2.0 because the switch to muliple
reports is a big change, and also this version is hopefully ready to support
Revio.

The code I have is ready to close 3 out of 4 open bugs, and seems to be working.
I need to:

1) Test delivery of data from the new version, possibly updating pbflags.py and
all that jazz. Like with NP there should be one YAML file per cell and it should
use the same schema to support barcodes (which have to come from SMRTLink -
implementation to come).

2) Relatedly, provide the summary requested by Urmi with stats per project

(see mail from Urmi @Wed, 18 Jan 2023 11:54:01 +0000)

Something like this can be generated by a new script in pb_utils.

3) Remove all the old test runs from the SMRTino web server.
Actually, I can do that now.
