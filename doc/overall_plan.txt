The overall plan is in an OO doc called "pacbio_pipeline.odt" so see that.

I may add a copy in here...

At the moment we have the crude cron job that makes tickets, and we have
~/workspace/pacbio_scripts/Snakefile.process_run that can process a whole run at once, but we
want to modify it to process a SMRT cell (or a group of them) at a time, in order to start processing the
first before the last is done.

I was simply running ~/workspace/pacbio_scripts/Snakefile.process_run direct from the shell, and the location
of /ifs/sequel/ was hard-coded in the script. The output location was the CWD.
