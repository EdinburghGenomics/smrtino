The overall plan is in an OO doc called "pacbio_pipeline.odt" so see that.

I may add a copy in here...

At the moment we have the crude cron job that makes tickets, and we have
~/workspace/pacbio_scripts/Snakefile.process_run that can process a whole run at once, but we
want to modify it to process a SMRT cell (or a group of them) at a time, in order to start processing the
first before the last is done.

I was simply running ~/workspace/pacbio_scripts/Snakefile.process_run direct from the shell, and the location
of /ifs/sequel/ was hard-coded in the script. The output location was the CWD.

After getting to the point of initial testing, I see I have a problem. I decided that the final output
of Snakefile.process_cells should be the .info.yml which has all the meta-data for the report. This
makes sense because then the report just needs to rearrange these files.

But there is some info in the files that we could potentially get right at the start. And maybe we do
want it - like the project ID. But I don't want to repeat the logic thet reads the XML files and I don't
want to have to wait until the BAM files are processed to get a summary of the run. What to do?
I think, this:

Summarize from the XML each time, but break the logic into a library. Yeah. OK.
