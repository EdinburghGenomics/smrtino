In my original cut of things, all the cells show up in the summary (as this is made from the
original dir and captures all XML) but the aborted cells are entirely absent from the report
(as this runs off the info.yml files and only shows processed cells).

I think we need some mention of the aborted cells in the final report. We could make stub
info.yml files for them but that breaks the idea that an info.yml file implies a properly
processed cell.

We could make an .aborted.yml file instead, that just copies the info from the XML such that
the report maker can scoop it up.

Or, for now, I'm just going to poke a list of the aborted cells into the report. We'll worry about
doing a better job in v1.0!
