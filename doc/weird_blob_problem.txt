So I was processing run r84140_20231204_172854 with SMRTino and a weird thing
happened.

The blob_chunk jobs were taking ages, and then I realised that every chunk
contained all 10000 sequences (and all 100 files were identical).

Also, some files were missing under m84140_231204_180701_s2.hifi_reads.unassigned+sub10000.fasta_parts
and the file timestamps are in random order, not sequential.

Very strange. I can't see any way that the split_fast_in_chunks could produce such a thing.

However, 3 of the four cells were processed first but failed, then the fourth cell was picked
up and processed. That fourth cell seems to have worked fine, but then it would have deleted
the fasta_parts directories for the partly run cells.

So when I resumed the three failed cells, the fasta_parts_list would have been there, but the
actual fasta_parts would have been missing.

So what happens if a part_XXXX.fasta is missing? Does Snakemake somehow magically recreate it?
Is there a smoking gun in the log?

Yes - the file is being recreated by "bam_to_subsampled_fasta" because it was removed while
Snakemake was still running as noted above. Oops.

I can see that wildcards.n="10000.fasta_parts/part_0036" and somehow "seqtk sample" accepts this.

So I need to:

    1) Ensure that "onsuccess" cleanup happens only for the cells being processed, not all cells
    2) Ensure that bam_to_subsampled_fasta does not think it can make files under
       .fasta_parts/ directories directly.

Both easy fixes. And I should be able to test this fairly easily.

Also, I realised if you remove the blob directory then the blob plots for completed cells won't
be recreated. I need to force a re-run of list_blob_plots to be sure. So...

    3) Make it so that removing the blob directory to force a rerun of the blob plots is OK

OK I tested but it's still not fixed. On trying to re-run /lustre-gseg/pacbio/pacbio_data/r84140_20231204_172854
I get MissingInputException for blast_chunk:
    blob/m84140_231204_173639_s1.hifi_reads.unassigned+sub10000.fasta_parts/part_0000.fasta

The file is gone because the Snakefile.process_cells worked and cleaned up the fasta_parts, but then the
Snakefile.report failed because some blob plots were missing. Now I was hoping the missing blob plots would
be recreated but not the ones for s1. Why is Snakemake trying to re-blast?

Maybe I can fix this by just removing the .fasta_parts_list files as well as the directories? Well let's see...
