From our point of view the new IIe instrument has two differences compared to the mark I:

More data produced.
Operates in two modes, the 'normal' mode is now where it does the CCS onboard and we never see
the subreads and scraps. But we still sometimes might. We have some example runs:

/fluidfs/sequel/r64175e_20201027_144023: scraps + subreads

/fluidfs/sequel/r64175e_20201027_155623: scraps + subreads

/fluidfs/sequel/r64175e_20201211_163702: CCS

First thing is we need to change the regex that matches run names. Where is this?

Sample config files. And I think that's it. The main config also needs fixed.

Let's work on r64175e_20201211_163702 first. No need to copy as SMRTino never writes to the source,
only the dest.
