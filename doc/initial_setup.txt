What do I like about Illuminatus and want to keep?

A directory of notes like this
the activate_venv script (that makes _py3_venv)
environ.sh.sample
driver.sh
rt_runticket_manager.py -> rt_pbrunticket_manager.py
RunStatus.py -> pb_run_status.py
upload_report.sh (with versioned uploading)
toolbox of links and wrapper scripts

So I set all this up and did some GIT commits.
