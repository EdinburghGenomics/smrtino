I wonder if I can screen for rRNA on every run? I already take a subset
of reads and BLAST them. So I could also align them vs. SILVA and report the
amount of ribosomal hits.

Problem is, this number is only really useful for RNA-Seq, and RNA-Seq is
Kinnex. So, to be useful we'd have to auto-run skera. Is this even possible?

And now we think about Kinnex. See kinnex.txt

Come back here once that is solved.
