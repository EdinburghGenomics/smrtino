Embedding the outputs from BLOBtools directly into the HTML is not going to work.

As they are tooo big.

Instead I'll use the same lightbox tech that I already added to the javascript for the project
QC reports. As a reminder - we add a tag like:

[plot](foo/bar.png){.thumbnail}

And the bar.png must be bar.__thumb.png.

I feel I'd like to make all the thumbnails as a separate step, just before making the report.
And I feel this should be run on the cluster.

Ah, but the sequelstats plots don't get made until the report does.

Erm.

No, let's have the thumbnails made at the same time as the blob plots.

And I'll have a rule in the Snakefile.report that gathers up all the images.

OK- added this last bit to "make_report"

Now to remove the image embedder.
