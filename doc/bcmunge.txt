The _bcmunge function in smrtino/ParseXML.py collapses barcodes like "bc2004--bc2004" into
"bc2004". The idea was that the XML files have this doubled up naming but the actual filenames
have the single naming.

But it seems we can't rely on that. The filenames are the filenames. If we run Lima in SMRTLink
we get the doubled-up names.

So I need to re-think. Probably I need two barcodes - the barcode in the filename which will
be got from the filename and never munged, and the barcode for display which will be got
from the XML and subject to munge.

At the moment, the "Read stats summary" has the un-munged barcode names so that's all arse about.
Meh.

So, I can fix this on test_pacbio_data/r84140_20241115_154613

I need to:

1) Have both the versions in bc.info.yaml
2) Ensure that get_revio_data works (so 'barcode' should come from the from the filename and
'barcode_squashed' should be the result of _bcmunge)
3) Have get_revio_data link to the squashed name, and have the delivery scripts deliver with
the squashed name.
4) Have _cstats use the squashed name so it appears on the reports correctly

OK, let's do this. Then the updated scan_cells.py which looks for redemultiplexes. Then the
ability to deliver cells while the QC is still running. And finally the (new) idea to reduce the
number of BLAST jobs dynamically if there are more than 4 samples.

OK, so let us go.
