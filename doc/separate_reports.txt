Javier's been asking for individual reports for a while.

I'll still have the pipeline logic as before, I think, but I'll
make a report per cell. And add all the separate links to the
RT messages.

What will this actully look like?

Title changes to "SMRT Cell <cellid>"

SMRTino version should be 2 if I get barcode support in there.

The "About this run" can stay. Change "Cells" to "Number of cells" and just print the count.

Remove PipelineStatus because now there will only ever be a complete report for a cell.

Change Heading from "SMRT Cells" to "Cell Info" and then "Cell QC"

Kill the "Binned Sequence Lengths". Do we want any other type of plot? Like can
we get a length/quality plot like we get from NanoPlot?
Can we run NanoPlot on PacBio input??

Anyway let's leave this for now as the SMRT Link QC is really what we look at.

For file names, remove the index.php and have the HTML report be something like:

1_m64175e_230221_122140.pan.html

The cells should sort anyway, but this makes it explicit.

OK so my first job is to look at the Snakefile and tell it to make three PanDoc reports
and 3 HTML reports, then work from there.
