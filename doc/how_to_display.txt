How to make the reports and display them?

Unlike with Illuminatus, I don't think we need to keep the report history
in the same way, as there is no re-running with new barcodes shenanigans.

However we do have interim reports. I'll add the number of cells to the report
name so that these don't get overwritten. Yeah.

And push to web1 as usual. Of course.
