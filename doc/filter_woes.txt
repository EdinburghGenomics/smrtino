So my original idea was that all the output files would be named .nocontrol.xxx
following the principle that if two files have the same name they should have the same
content and so if there is a chance we might actually be filtering the content then
we should rename the files. So far, so good.

But then if we rename the files, the .subreadset.xml becomes invalid, as it refers to
the original file names.

Also note that we always need the original subreadset.xml as it contains vital infos
about the sample etc.

So, annoying as it is, how about this:

The .nocontrol should only be applied if it is actually needed. If not, the files are copied
and all is well.

If bam2bam is invoked then the original subreadset.xml should be copied, and this should always be
the source of meta-data. But obviously the metrics need to be calculated on the filtered file,
so the .csv always needs to be on the .nocontrol file.

Hmmm. Annoying.
