Since I now have all the basics coded, how about going for a first release?

Things that need testing:

1) A run where adapter removal is needed - r54041_20180525_175829, even though it's broken.
2) Messages going to RT (using the 'testing' queue)
3) Show reports to Urmi

I'll process r54041_20180525_175829 in the test environment now and check the output
is right and check the mails look right and send the report to Urmi.

$ test/end_to_end/link_a_run.sh r54041_20180525_175829 ~/test_sequel

Synthesize one cell not being ready to test that bit.

$ ( cd /lustre/home/tbooth2/test_sequel/r54041_20180525_175829/4_D01 ;
    mv m54041_180526_063604.transferdone m54041_180526_063604.transferdone.not )

And I set RT messages to go to test-rt and reports to go to web1. Now run the driver.

OK, all looks good. Are the .nocontrol files identical to the ones we obtained before?
Yes, aside from the @PG line in the header which has changed since we used the copy of
the adapter files on /lustre not /fluidfs.

Then release 0.0.1 as pipeline user.

Current target is /lustre/pacbio/pacbio_data/. I'd like to re-run all the 2018 runs,
so the new target will be /lustre/pacbio/pacbio_data_new. Then once we're all happy I'll
switch and rename pacbio_data->pacbio_data_old and pacbio_data_new->pacbio_data.

I'll do that initial testing on test-rt so as not to spam the real RT, but I will run it off
the pipeline account.

It's fine that my pipeline is writing back pbpipe directories to the original locations as
there is nothing like this in the old scripts.
# Addendum - now it doesn't do that anyway!

Once the pipeline is working, including RT mails:

-1) Release new pacbio_scripts
0) Move all the 2017 runs to a 2017 subdirectory (2016 also) and think about deletion
1) Switch off the old cron task and the test cron
2) Rename the directories as above
3) Reconfigure environ.sh and also rt_settings (if need be - test the script can modify a real ticket)
4) Switch [back] on the new CRON job
5) Reprocess a recent run to test it
6) Fetch data and do a dummy delivery to test pacbio_scripts
