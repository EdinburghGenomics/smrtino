We had this issue some time ago on Illuminatus, but now we see it for a failed
run on Revio. What do we do if a barcode produces zero reads?

On Illuminatus, we just don't create the file, but we do show the lines in the
report because we pick up the samples from the Stats.json.

In SMRTino, we should probably do the same, but for this we need to detect
empty BAM files while running scan_cells.py, which is not impossible but is
a bit annoying. Then I'd need to add a bunch of if/else to the Snakefile to
only produce .fastq.gz and .count files if the BAM is non-empty.

So for now, let's see if I can just make it work with empty .fastq.gz files.
I should fix the counting script anyway.
