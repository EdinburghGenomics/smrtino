Urmi has given some guidance on what she wants to see in the reports regarding stats,
so I can make a start.

Also there is my initial work scraping info out of the XML files.

And there are some internal things I need to report like was the filter applied or not.

All the actual processing should be done by Snakefile.process_cells which can run whatever
jobs it needs on the cluster, but should only act on specific cells at once.

The summary report is made by Snakefile.report. It doesn't have much to do, just to trigger
building of a pandoc report and conversion of that to HTML.

The report should not need to read the pacbio XML files directly, as everything it needs in
this regard should come from the info.yml files. I'm not sure if it wants to read the CSV files
or not. I think it does.

Note - for testing CSV files, here's a nice small BAM file:

samtools fasta /lustre/pacbio/pacbio_data/r54041_20180705_170900/m54041_180706_115949.nocontrol.subreads.bam | less

So we need:

1) A script that reads the xml and makes the yaml - compile_cell_info.py

Where was that old code???
scan_for_smrt_cells in get_pacbio_yml.py seems to be it.

Also see the notes in sequelstats.txt

2) A script that formats the PanDoc reports - make_report.py

Initially I'll make this super super simple. Just cat everything into a big report.
In fact, it will never be particularly complex.

How frequently to e-mail?

At the moment I'm making a new report every time anything happens, which is essentially
C+2 - once at the start and once for each cell that finishes and finally for the final
report. This is leading to a lot of redundant comments on the ticket, but maybe that's OK.

And I'm still not sure if I want to split the cell_ready state into idle/processing and
prevent multiple snakefiles working at once but that can be added in later.
