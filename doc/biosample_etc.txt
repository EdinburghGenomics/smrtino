I need to properly formalise where the names of samples come from in PacBio land.

We have:

Names from the LIMS (as matched to internal sample name)
Names from ConsensusReadSet.Name
Names from BioSample

Looking at:
/lustre-gseg/pacbio/pacbio_data/r84140_20231004_115851/m84140_231004_123717_s2/bc1010/m84140_231004_123717_s2.hifi_reads.bc1010.consensusreadset.xml

It's a test dataset, so not a good production example, but still:

ConsensusReadSet.Name is "23391TA-Cell2 (23391TA RF)"
BioSample name is "23391TA RF"

I'm not sure is this was inputted twice or copied by SMRTLink. Hmmm.

Anyway, the "23391TA RF" part should probably be saved into the info.yaml and available for
use as the external_id, for when the LIMS completely packs in.

Anyway, I can worry about this later.
